    "The Bellman equation for an economy with both households and firms would involve the utility of the household and the production function of the firm. Households maximize their utility, which includes consumption and leisure, while firms maximize profits by choosing labor and capital. Then, these decisions interact through markets—like labor markets where wages are determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for the household's problem, they have preferences over consumption and leisure. The utility function is usually something like Cobb-Douglas or CES. A standard one would be: $ U(c, l) = c^{1 - \\alpha} l^{\\alpha} $, where $ c $ is consumption and $ l $ is leisure. But in the RBC model, they often use time instead of leisure, so maybe it's $ U(h) = h^{1 - \\gamma} $, where $ h $ is hours worked? \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard setup has households choosing how much to consume and how much time to supply. So, the utility function might depend on consumption and leisure, which is 1 minus labor supplied. Or sometimes it's modeled as a CRRA utility over consumption and leisure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RBC model, for simplicity, they often consider that households maximize utility over consumption and leisure, with leisure being $ (1 - h) $ where $ h $ is hours worked. So perhaps the utility function is something like $ U(c, l) = c^{1 - \\alpha} l^{\\beta} $, but I'm not sure about the exact form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, firms produce output using capital and labor. The production function is typically Cobb-Douglas: $ Y = A K^{\\theta} L^{1 - \\theta} $, where $ A $ is productivity, which can be subject to shocks. So, that's important—productivity is an exogenous shock in the RBC model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bellman equation, we usually have a recursive formulation where at each time period, the agent decides optimally considering future decisions. For the household, they would choose consumption and labor supply, knowing the productivity state, and then updating based on future shocks."

    "So, putting this together, the Bellman equation for the RBC model should incorporate the current utility from consumption and leisure, plus the discounted expected utility from future states. The discount factor is typically $ \\beta $, which is less than 1, reflecting time preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state variables would include the capital stock and the productivity shock. Let the productivity shock be denoted as $ A_t $. So, at each time $t$, the state is $ (K_t, A_t) $.\n",

    "Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to consider that households choose consumption and labor supply, while firms set prices or real wages based on the production function. \n",
    "So, in equilibrium, we have a competitive allocation where the household's decisions are influenced by the prices and wage rates, which depend on the aggregate productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the Bellman equation, the household would optimize over current consumption and leisure (or labor), knowing that future states depend on the productivity shock next period. But also, capital is part of the state because it affects production possibilities.\n",

    "But if we're modeling the entire economy, perhaps the state vector includes the productivity shock $ A_t $ and the capital stock $ K_t $. So the value function $ V(K_t, A_t) $ represents the maximum utility attainable from that state.\n",

    "Since all variables are chosen optimally by the representative agent, maybe we can aggregate everything into one decision variable.\n",
