# Learning and Teaching Economics

## Purpose and context

- involve students in your choice of the method of teching
- give students the tools to monitor themselves
- try new things --> assess the new approach
- learning is an **active process** : challenge the students, enable them to interrogate, analyse, evaluate
- consider whether your students (**active learning**):
  - challenge assumptions
  - take intellectual risks
  - devise strategies to overcome barriers
- establish links between subject lessons
  - understand how various concepts in a subject fit together
  - make connections between different areas of knowledge
  - transfer skills from one discipline to another
- build up **disciplinary knowledge**, which will allow :
  - to get better at solving complex problems
  - generate new ideas
  - interpret the world around you  
- understanding of the world :
  - why is a given topic important on a **personal** scale
  - why is a given topic important on a **local** scale
  - why is a given topic important on a **global** scale
  - do you realise the **implications of what you are learning** ? 
    - how will this knowledge and the skills affect your neighbours and the wider world ?
    - to what extent can you recognise and express your own perspective as well as the perspectives of others
- what are **your barriers to your learning**
  - is it the English lanhuage ?
  - is it the subject jargon ? 
  - are you an effective communicator (written and verbal) ?
  - are you information literate?
