# Introduction to Computational Science

## Modeling

>  **Modeling** is the application of methods to analyze complex, real-world problems in order to make predictions about what might happen with various actions.

Steps of the modelin process :
1. Analyze the problem
2. Formulate a model
   1. Gather data
   2. Make simplifying assumptions and document them
   3. Determine variables and units
   4. Establish relationships among variables and submodels
   5. Determine equations and functions
3. Solve the model
4. Verify and interpret the modelâ€™s solution
5. Report on the model
   1. Analysis of the problem
   2. Model design
   3. Model solution
   4. Results and conclusions
6. Maintain the model
