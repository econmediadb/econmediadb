## Data

- Indicators to measure inequality
  - Gini coefficient : ranks a country’s income inequality between zero and one. Zero means everyone in the country gets the same income; one means a single person receives everything.

- average tax structure : value-added tax, other taxes on goods and services, social-security contributions, corporate income tax, personal income tax, property, others ( see The Economist 455, pages 41-42; 2025, Jun 07 )

## Factors that affect inequality

- economic growth
- minimum wage 
  - Mexico : Mexico’s last president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, doubled it in real terms during his six years in office. Claudia Sheinbaum, his successor, has promised annual increases of 12%
  - limits of this approach : if productivity does not also increase, a rising minimum wage tends to increase informal jobs, dragging people back into the inequality feedback loop.
- redistribution : 
  - slow growth --> thin government revenues --> less money to redistribute  
  - in rich countries : taxes and transfers reduce the Gini coefficient by almost 40%
  - in Latin America : they only reduce it by about 5%.
  - in OECD countries (mainly rich economies) : personal income taxes, which are usually progressive, are worth 8% of GDP
  - in Latin America : they are worth just 2% (the region relies more on indirect taxes, such as VAT on goods and services, which are often regressive - the rich and poor pay the same rate but the poor consume a larger portion of their income, so are hit harder)
  - see "A poor tax" chart in The Economist (455, pages 41-42; 2025, Jun 07)
  - difficulty of implementing higher taxes : mistrust the state and ruling elites
- political reform : build trust in government and allow for improvements to taxation and welfare  

## Consequences of inequality

- anger about disparities : violent protests in Chile in 2019

## Research

### Heavy inﬂuence of family background 

A paper by Paolo Brunori of the University of Florence and co-authors ﬁnds that more than half of the current
generation’s inequality is in effect inherited, largely as a result of their parents’ level of education and type of jobs.

(...)

As Ana María Ibáñez of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and co-authors explain, toddlers of richer parents often get better food and more attention, so develop more skills.

This helps them take advantage of the better (often private) schools they attend, which in turn push them on to university where attendance strongly boosts earnings in Latin America, in large part by helping students get formal jobs in big companies.

Children born into poorer families tend to go to worse schools, often don’t make it to university and end up working in Latin America’s large, less productive informal sector. And so the cycle revolves.

### Personal-ﬁnance system that needs ﬁxing, since it produces bad outcomes for many, and especially for poor people

John Campbell and Tarun Ramadorai, two professors of economics at Harvard University and Imperial College London, argue that those with unmanageable debts, or volatile incomes that barely cover their spending, ﬁnd ﬁnance particularly unpleasant, and ﬁrms exploit this (developed in their book with the title _Fixed_).

Finance widens wealth inequality, since rich people earn higher returns on their assets and pay less interest on their debts.

A study in Sweden between 2000 and 2007, for instance, found that those in the poorest decile by wealth earned only the risk-free interest rate on their assets.

Those in the richest decile earned between five and eight percentage points a year more. 

They also paid only one to two percentage points above the risk-free rate in interest on their debts, while those in the poorest decile paid a spread of four (and those in the second-poorest paid seven).

Rich people also save more of their incomes than poor ones.

_the annuity puzzle_ : Purchasing annuities allows the retired to efficiently pool the risk that they live longer than expected, guaranteeing an income that is higher than the amount they could spend if relying on individual savings.
